These files  enable to you to build the app when you are getting started.

1. Copy all of these files into your local folder
2. Run "make" to get an executable object called bogtest
3. Run "./bogtest" will give you the testing results.
4. Modify the files until you can pass the test.
5. Design your own testcases and then modify bogtest.cpp to test your codes.

After you have completed the above 5 steps, you can consider the GUI.
The GUI is there for you to confirm that your code works correctly.
